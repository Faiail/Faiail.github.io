Introduction
============

The PIXEL ART course, aimed at a second-year middle school class, was designed to provide students with an overview of the fundamental concepts of computer science and its practical applications, with particular attention to the world of pixel art and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. The structure of the course made it possible to cover a wide range of topics, from the functioning of computer components to the use of microcontrollers such as Arduino, up to artificial intelligence applied to art.

Introduction to Computer Science
--------------------------------

**1.1 Computer Components**  
The course began with an overview of the fundamental components of a computer. Students learned the main functions of the CPU, RAM, hard drives, motherboards, and other peripherals. This introduction provided the foundation for understanding how a computer processes and stores information.

**1.2 Conceptualization of an Algorithm**  
Next, the concept of an algorithm was introduced. Students learned that an algorithm is a sequence of finite and well-defined instructions that, starting from a certain input, lead to a specific output. This part of the course included simple and easily understandable examples, such as instructions for making a sandwich.

Introduction to the Concept of Abstraction
------------------------------------------

**2.1 Definition and Use**  
The concept of abstraction was explained as the process of reducing complexity by eliminating irrelevant details and keeping only essential information. In the context of computer science, abstraction makes it possible to focus on the relevant features of a problem without being overwhelmed by the details.

**2.2 Practical Examples**  
Students carried out practical exercises to understand abstraction, such as simplifying complex problems into more manageable steps and creating models that represent only the crucial aspects of the problem.

Introduction to Algorithms
--------------------------

**3.1 Theory and Tools**  
In the next phase, the course delved into the theory of algorithms, explaining various types of algorithms (e.g., sorting and searching algorithms) and their areas of application. Tools such as flowcharts were introduced to visualize and plan algorithms.

**3.2 Practical Exercises**  
Students had the opportunity to write and test their own algorithms using simple programming languages. This allowed them to see in practice how algorithmic instructions can solve specific problems.

Application of Algorithms in Real Life
--------------------------------------

**4.1 Computer Science in Everyday Life**  
To show the importance of computer science in everyday life, the course included practical exercises such as simulating the purchase of a product on an e-commerce website. Students were able to see how algorithms are used to improve efficiency and user experience on these platforms.

**4.2 Exercises in Python**  
Using Google Colab, students wrote simple Python programs to solve everyday problems. These exercises reinforced their understanding of the theoretical concepts previously introduced and demonstrated the importance of programming as a tool to automate and simplify tasks.

Arduino and Microcontrollers
----------------------------

**5.1 Introduction to Microcontrollers**  
The course introduced Arduino as an example of a microcontroller, explaining what microcontrollers are and how they can be used to control electronic devices.

**5.2 Basic Simulation Exercises**  
Students carried out practical exercises with Arduino, such as programming a blinking LED, simulating a traffic light, and displaying a "hello world" message on an LCD screen. These exercises provided practical understanding of how microcontrollers can be programmed to perform specific tasks.

Artificial Intelligence
-----------------------

**6.1 Definition and Potential**  
The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) was presented to students, explaining what AI is, its potential, and its limitations. It was discussed how AI can be used in various sectors, from medicine to industrial automation, as well as the potential risks associated with improper use of these technologies.

AI in Art
---------

**7.1 Generative and Predictive Systems**  
A fascinating part of the course was dedicated to the application of AI in art. Students learned how generative systems can create original works of art and how predictive systems can be used to analyze and forecast artistic trends.

**7.2 Generating Works of Art**  
Students had the opportunity to generate their first artwork using generative algorithms. They explored how these algorithms can apply different painting styles to images, creating unique works.

**7.3 Inpainting**  
The course concluded with an introduction to inpainting, a technique that uses AI to fill in missing parts of an image. It was explained how this technology can be used by art experts for the restoration and conservation of damaged works.

Conclusion
----------

The PIXEL ART course offered second-year middle school students a comprehensive and engaging overview of the world of computer science, with a particular focus on the practical and creative applications of this discipline. Through theoretical lessons, practical exercises, and the use of modern tools such as Python, Google Colab, and Arduino, students acquired fundamental skills that they will be able to use in their academic journey and in everyday life.

The combination of theory and practice allowed students not only to understand how the technologies they use daily work, but also how they can use them creatively and innovatively. The section dedicated to artificial intelligence and art particularly stimulated their imagination, showing how technology can be used to express creativity in new and surprising ways.

In summary, the course successfully achieved its educational objectives, providing students with a solid foundation in computer science and inspiring them to further explore this fascinating field.
